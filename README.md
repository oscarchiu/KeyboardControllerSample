# KeyboardControllerSample

It is an easy way to handle view animation when keyboard showing and hiding.

1. Create a KeyboardController
2. Set delegate of KeyboardController
3. Call didBeginEditing when some UIKeyInput object is about to begin editing
4. Done
5. Remember to set delegate of UITextField or something...

Have a nice day.
